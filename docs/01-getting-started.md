# 🚀 Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the React 19 Todo Application! This guide will help you understand and run the project step by step.

## 📋 What is This Project?

This is a **Todo Application** - a simple app where you can:
- ✅ Add tasks you need to do
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete when done
- ✅ Edit tasks by double-clicking them
- ✅ Delete tasks you no longer need
- ✅ Filter tasks to see all, active, or completed ones

## 🛠️ What Technologies Are We Using?

### React 19 🆕
- **What it is**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Why we use it**: Makes building interactive websites easier
- **What's new in React 19**: Faster performance and better user experience

### TypeScript 📝
- **What it is**: JavaScript with type checking
- **Why we use it**: Helps catch errors before they happen
- **Example**: Instead of just `let name`, we write `let name: string`

### Tailwind CSS 🎨
- **What it is**: A CSS framework for styling
- **Why we use it**: Makes styling faster and consistent
- **Example**: Instead of writing CSS, we use classes like `bg-blue-500 text-white`

### Vite ⚡
- **What it is**: A build tool for web development
- **Why we use it**: Makes development faster with instant updates

1. `TodoItem.tsx` - See how a single todo works
2. `TodoList.tsx` - See how multiple todos are displayed
3. `TodoInput.tsx` - See how new todos are added

### Q: What makes this different from other todo apps?
**A**: This app uses React 19's latest features:
- **Faster updates**: Changes appear instantly
- **Better performance**: Smooth animations and interactions
- **Modern patterns**: Code that follows current best practices

### Q: How long will it take to understand this project?
**A**: Depends on your experience:
- **Complete beginner**: 2-3 weeks of study
- **Some JavaScript knowledge**: 1-2 weeks
- **React experience**: 3-5 days to understand React 19 features

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If Something Doesn't Work:
1. **Check the terminal** for error messages
2. **Make sure all dependencies are installed**: Run `pnpm install` again
3. **Restart the development server**: Press `Ctrl+C` then run `pnpm dev`

### If You Want to Learn More:
- Read the other documentation files in the `docs/` folder
- Check the [React official documentation](https://react.dev)
- Look at the code comments - they explain what each part does

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once you have the app running:
1. **Play around with it** - Add some todos, mark them complete
2. **Read the Component Guide** (`docs/02-components-guide.md`)
3. **Learn about React 19 features** (`docs/03-react19-features.md`)
4. **Try making small changes** to see how they affect the app
